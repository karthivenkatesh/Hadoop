Meta data
=========
Files are divided into blocks based on dfs.blocksize (default 128 mb).

Each block have block id, block pool id,file permission, block location called as metadata of file.

Meta data stored in memory on NN.

Namenode
========
NN is a memory component and is also a demon process.It's stores all metadata(in memory).

Metadata is stored on disk on NN. Information about file location, ownership,permission, name of individual blocks, block location.

NN have two important components which used to recover NN.
1)FSimage
2)Edit logs 


Datanode
========
Actual content of files stored in DN.

Name starts like blk_XXXXX

Each slave node runs a DN deamon.

Its also do checksum process.


Secondary Namenode
==================
It only do the book keeping of NN.

It used to merge the fsimage and edit logs and create new fsimage at regular intervals and sent back to NN.


Name Node recovery
===================
Edit logs:
==========
Every one hour, changes in NN metadata called as transaction are logged in to edit logs.

FSimage
=======
It only contains files and blocks name not contain block locations.

Command
========
sudo -u hdfs hdfs dfsadmin -safmode enter
sudo -u hdfs hdfs dfsadmin -saveNamespace   ---> to create new fsimage
sudo -u hdfs hdfs dfsadmin -safmode leave

The process done to create fsimage called checkpoint.

Recovery process.
=================
1)Restart the NN.

2)Restore latest FSimage

3)Recovers using latest edit log.

4) NN will do roll call to DN to determine block locations.
