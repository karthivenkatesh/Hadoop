To maintain Fault tolerance in hadoop cluster replication factor and rack awareness comes in picture.

Replication Factor.
==================
 By deafult is 3 and mirros the data two times and maintain fault tolerance at disk level.
	
Rack Awareness
===============
Rack is nothing but a cointainer which have multiple server.In Data nodes, fault tolerance taken care by replication factor.
1)In production cluster, all your DN's divided and grouped together called racks.
2)It takes care of fault tolerance at network level.
3)DN use network switches to communicate each other or with other DN on different racks.
4)HDFS block placement will be happen using the "Data placement policy" or "Replica placement policy".
5)NN connect to DN through network switch, if the switch goes down, it becomes problem for NN to get block for processing.
6)By default two out of three replicas stored in one rack of different machines and third replica stored in some other rack of DN.
7)If any of the switch goes down, NN will not have problem to communicate with he same data resides on DN in different rack through other network switch, get it for processing.
8)Replica placement policy depends on three main factors as "Reliability, Availability and Network Bandwidth utilizatio".
9)If more replica's the system is more reliable, available and less n/w utilization & write performance.
10)If less replica's the system is less reliable, available and more n/w utilization & write performance.

HeartBeat and Block report
==========================
Copies of blocks are stored in DN and NN having metadata of blocks.

Default Block size = 128 mb in Hadoop 2.X and 64 mb in Hadoop 1.x

Every 3 sec DN send its heartbeat to NN along with heartbeat it sends 
1)Disk capacity
2)current activity

HeartBeat
========== 
	dfs.heartbeat.interval = 3 
	
Block report.
=============
DN periodically send block report to NN.
 Default is 6 hours.
 
 dfs.blockreport=6
 
CheckSum
=========
It's used to ensure the blocks or files are not corrupted  while files are being read from HDFS or write to HDFS

It's nothing but a hash value of the content in file to be copied.
